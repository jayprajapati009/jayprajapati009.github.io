              Quadruped<br />
              Four Legged Robot
            </h2>
            <p>
              In this project, I led the design and development of a quadruped
              robot, which involved complex mechanical, electrical, and software
              integration. The goal was to create a robust, four-legged
              autonomous robot capable of navigating dynamic environments. Using
              CAD tools like Solidworks and PTC Creo, I designed the robot’s
              structure, focusing on weight distribution and mechanical
              strength. The control system relied on ROS and a custom motion
              planning algorithm that allowed the robot to adjust its gait in
              real-time based on the environment. I implemented dynamic path
              planning to ensure obstacle avoidance and smooth navigation. This
              project won a state-level robotics championship and significantly
              advanced my understanding of autonomous navigation and robotic
              kinematics.<br />

            <p>
              In this project, I developed a software module for a multi-robot
              system, focusing on coordination and communication between robots.
              The system was designed to optimize task execution by distributing
              tasks among multiple robots, ensuring efficient task completion
              with minimal redundancy. I used ROS to manage inter-robot
              communication and integrated sensors for real-time data exchange,
              enabling the robots to adjust their paths based on the actions of
              other robots in the system. This project demonstrated my ability
              to build complex systems that require real-time collaboration
              between autonomous robots.

            <p>
              This project involved the development of dynamic path-planning
              algorithms for an autonomous robot to navigate unpredictable
              environments. Using ROS and Gazebo for simulation, I implemented
              global path planning using Dijkstra and A* algorithms, while
              employing local planners for real-time obstacle avoidance. The
              robot successfully navigated a test environment while dynamically
              adjusting its path based on sensor input. This project not only
              refined my understanding of planning algorithms but also helped me
              master ROS and simulation tools like Rviz and Gazebo.

            <p>
              This project aimed to assist visually impaired individuals by
              developing an AI-driven image captioning system. I trained a deep
              learning model using the Inception V3 CNN encoder for feature
              extraction, reaching a 92% accuracy rate in generating descriptive
              captions from real-time video feeds. To optimize real-time
              performance, I implemented Block Static Expansion and multi-headed
              attention vectors, which improved both accuracy and response time.
              Additionally, I developed Python scripts for seamless integration
              with mobile devices, enabling visually impaired users to capture
              and process video in real-time, with automatic caption generation
              and voice narration. This project highlighted my ability to apply
              AI solutions for real-world accessibility challenges.

            <p>
              This project revolved around real-time food item segmentation
              using deep learning techniques. I employed RNN-based ResNet50 and
              PointRend architectures to achieve an 80% accuracy rate in food
              item segmentation from live video feeds. Using transfer learning,
              I was able to improve model performance, reaching 67% test
              accuracy on a limited dataset of 4,935 training images and 2,135
              test images, outperforming a custom model’s 43% accuracy.
              Fine-tuning pre-trained architectures allowed me to develop a
              reliable and efficient segmentation system, which was aimed at
              applications in food identification and inventory management in
              commercial kitchens.

              robot capable of picking and placing color-coded blocks in a
              designated area. I engineered a real-time color detection system
              using a Pi Camera, which was integrated with the A* path planning
              algorithm to ensure accurate retrieval and placement of the
              blocks. The robot was equipped with IMU sensors (MPU6050) and
              encoders for precise navigation, and I implemented PID control for
              stable maneuvering. Obstacle avoidance was achieved through the
              use of ultrasonic sensors, allowing the robot to navigate
              dynamically changing environments. The project achieved an 80%
              success rate in goal placement, demonstrating effective robot
              localization and task execution.

              In this project, I led a team to scan and 3D print miniature
              replicas of an 11ft statue to celebrate the 75th anniversary of my

              of the original statue, and I led the scanning process to ensure
              accuracy and completeness of the data. Using Fusion 360, I
              performed reverse engineering to create a CAD model from the
              scanned data. I then used 3D printing technology to produce
              prototypes with different printing parameters, optimizing for
              quality, speed, and material usage. The final models were produced

              This project focused on building a human tracking system using
              advanced object detection algorithms in C++. I integrated the
              YOLOv3 model for real-time detection, which achieved an 84%
              confidence level and 99 ms inference time on the MS-COCO dataset.
              I also incorporated a KCF tracker for precise tracking across
              164,000 images, enabling reliable performance in dynamic
              environments. This project demonstrated significant improvement in

              integrated CI/CD pipelines with Travis CI and Coveralls, which
              boosted code quality and testing coverage. The module was used in

              In this perception-focused project, I worked with the TurtleBot 3
              WafflePi to autonomously navigate through a set of waypoints on a
              flat surface. My key contribution was calibrating the monocular
              camera using a checkerboard pattern to derive intrinsic and
              extrinsic parameters. From there, I calculated the homography of
              the floor, identified the vanishing point, and determined the
              horizon line, enabling the robot to detect and follow waypoints
              seamlessly. Additionally, I integrated YOLO-based stop sign
              detection, allowing the robot to recognize and respond to stop
              signs in varying orientations. This project sharpened my skills in
              perception, camera calibration, and robot path planning.

            <p>
              I co-invented a patented IoT-based wastewater spillage detection
              system designed to monitor and alert authorities of any spillage
              in real-time. The system integrates multiple sensors to detect
              abnormal spillage patterns, and the data is transmitted via IoT
              devices to a centralized system for monitoring and action. This
              project combined sensor networks, data transmission protocols, and
              environmental monitoring technologies to create a solution that
              can have a significant impact on environmental safety.

            <!-- <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="" alt="" /></a> -->
            <p>
              I developed a RESTful API server to manage a collection of
              OpenRAVE robots using Debian , Docker, and Python. This project
              aimed to provide a scalable and efficient solution for handling
              multiple robot configurations stored in JSON format. I utilized
              Python's Flask framework to implement CRUD operations, allowing
              for seamless robot data management through endpoints for adding,
              updating, and deleting robot specifications. Additionally, I
              containerized the API server using Docker to ensure consistent
              deployment and compatibility across different environments. The
              server could efficiently parse JSON requests, validate robot
              parameters, and provide real-time data response, thereby improving
              the robotic fleet management workflow. This project deepened my
              understanding of REST API architecture, Docker containerization,
              and robotic data handling.

              This project involved setting up a robotic control system for a
              collaborative robot (FRCobot) using ROS2, leveraging its real-time
              communication capabilities with DDS (Data Distribution Service)
              for reliable control. I created a ROS2 workspace and developed
              custom Python nodes for joint control, sensor processing, and
              safety features. Using URDF models, I defined the robot's
              kinematics and visualized it in RViz2, ensuring accurate
              transformations. I also configured MoveIt2 for motion planning,
              enabling pick-and-place and obstacle avoidance tasks, and
              integrated Gazebo for simulation to validate control algorithms
              before hardware deployment.

              <h2>Autonomous Rover for Indoor and Outdoor Navigation<br /></h2>
            </header>
            <!-- <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="" alt="" /></a> -->
            <p>
              I designed and developed an autonomous rover capable of navigating
              both indoor and outdoor environments using SLAM-based and
              GPS-based navigation, respectively. The rover's indoor navigation
              was achieved using the Gmapping SLAM algorithm, which combined
              LIDAR and wheel odometry data for precise localization and mapping
              of the environment. For outdoor navigation, I integrated a GPS
              module that allowed the rover to accurately navigate through
              predefined waypoints in open areas. The project also involved
              developing a ROS-based control system to seamlessly switch between
              SLAM and GPS modes, ensuring continuous navigation without manual
              intervention. I implemented an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to
              fuse sensor data, achieving high accuracy in localization and
              reducing drift over time. Despite constraints on funding and a
              tight timeline, I sourced aluminum materials and fabricated custom
              mounts to house the sensors and electronic components, maintaining
              a balance between durability and weight. The final prototype
              demonstrated robust autonomous navigation in a mixed environment,
              showcasing my proficiency in integrating SLAM, GPS, and ROS, as
              well as expertise in sensor fusion techniques for practical
              robotic applications.
